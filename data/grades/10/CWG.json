  "content_standard": "10.11 Students analyze the integration of countries into the world economy and the information, technological, and communications revolutions (e.g., television, satellites, computers).",
  "overview": "This unit covers the accelerated trend of **globalization**—the freer and faster movement of people, ideas, capital, and resources across borders—intensified by the end of World War II and the dissolution of the Cold War. The modern period is defined by global conflict and cooperation, economic growth and collapse, and global independence and connection. Contemporary challenges such as environmental degradation, global climate change, cross-border crime, and enduring inequalities now transcend national borders.",

        "Economic globalization was key to the development of **communications technology** that enables financial information and funds to move easily across borders.",
        "New technologies also facilitate the spread of consumer products, popular media, and advertising globally.",
        "The world has experienced a return to globalizing patterns since the 1970s, spurred by electronic communications, lower international transportation costs (like containerized shipping), and market deregulation.",
        "Globalization empowers multinational corporations (MNCs), exemplified by **'modular production'** where goods like the Apple iPod are designed in one country (California) and assembled in another (China) using components from many different countries.",
        "The authority of the nation-state appears increasingly feeble in relation to this globalization of economic activity."

      "theme": "II. Inequality and Criticism of Globalization",
      "details": [
        "Economists generally credit globalization with increasing overall wealth and well-being worldwide.",
        "However, globalization has **not necessarily reduced economic inequalities** among societies.",
        "Mobility of capital and goods is not fully shared by labor; manufacturers can easily relocate production to low-wage countries (e.g., Mexico) to reduce costs, but it is much harder for workers to immigrate legally to high-wage countries (e.g., the U.S.).",
        "Critics assert that globalization results in **'exporting' jobs** from industrialized nations and exploiting low-wage and child laborers in developing nations.",
        "Negative effects include environmental concerns, the proliferation of slums, pollution of local ecosystems, and the homogenization of culture ('McDonaldization').",
        "Globalization has also contributed to the rise and spread of **extremist movements and terrorist organizations**."

        "The end of the Cold War (1989–1991) briefly inspired dreams of a stable 'New World Order,' which were soon displaced by conflicts following events like 9/11 (2001).",
        "The **Universal Declaration of Human Rights** (1948) affirms broad freedoms for all individuals, regardless of citizenship, but its enforcement is often limited by the convention of **state sovereignty**.",
        "The contemporary era has witnessed a dramatic **worldwide religious revival**, creating new political cleavages within and among societies.",
        "Both human rights advocates and religious leaders affirm the existence of authorities higher than national governments, whether 'natural law' or holy law, making the individual a member of an 'identity community' larger than the nation-state."

        "The rise of Europe to global dominance is now being reversed by contemporary trends.",

        "**Asia is projected to be the center of global economic activity in the twenty-first century**.",
        "China's economy has skyrocketed as a major manufacturer, fueled by market-oriented growth and exports, enabling it to become a major financial player that loans money to the U.S. (creating 'Chimerica').",
        "Other rising states, such as Brazil, Russia, and India, have also become dominant regional and global powers, making the global scene less predictable and hierarchical than in past centuries."
